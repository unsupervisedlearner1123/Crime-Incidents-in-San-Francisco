# Crime-Incidents-in-San-Francisco
Predicting the number of crimes for every neighborhood of San Francisco 

The dataset chosen for this analysis is the incident report maintained by the San Francisco Police Department (https://datasf.org/opendata/), which includes incident reports that have been filed as of January 1, 2018. These reports are filed by officers or self-reported by members of the public using SFPDâ€™s online reporting system.

Data is added to open data once incident reports have been reviewed and approved by a supervising Sergeant or Lieutenant. Incident reports may be removed from the dataset if in compliance with court orders to seal records or for administrative purposes such as active internal affair investigations and/or criminal investigations.

The dataset is updated daily by 10:00 A.M. Pacific time. Each row is an incident record, with details about date, place, time of occurence. For detailed overview on the dataset attributes, head over here :  https://data.sfgov.org/d/wg3w-h783
